# PhD
Pound Head on Desk now; or, my PhD - writing and related byproducts.  

## Purpose 
I am putting my unfinished PhD thesis on GitHub in order to account for the time spent working on it, and to better track its progress. This repository contains the following:
  * a horrifying jumble of R code and scripts I am using to analyze my data.
  * figures - some only exploratory, some cleaned-up for final inclusion in the text.
  * the text of each chapter of the thesis (in Bulgarian).

## Copyright
This work is Copyright 2012-2016 Stefania Klayn and the Institute of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Research (IBER-BAS). **You are not allowed to reproduce or modify this work.** 

## Remarks
That said, feel free to look. I doubt anything here will be of much use, help or interest to anyone, since the data is not included, the text is in an obscure language, and the quality of the code reflects my programming skills (namely, total novice). I refuse to be embarrassed by (most) things here. 
Bottom line: venture in at your own risk! Content may induce loss of faith in humanity!

There is no commercial interest in this work, either as a (potential) book or in any other practical way.
